  # Klarity 

  _Understand what your model is thinking_
</div>

## üéØ Overview

Klarity is a powerful tool for understanding the uncertainty in language model outputs. Unlike traditional confidence scores, Klarity combines advanced analysis with LLM-powered insights to give you a clear understanding of your model's behaviour.

### üîç What sets Klarity apart?

- **Semantic Analysis**: Goes beyond raw probability distributions to understand the meaning-based uncertainty
- **Intelligent Insights**: LLM-powered analysis of semantic patterns
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Get actionable suggestions for handling uncertainty cases

## ü§ñ Supported Models

| Model | Type | Status | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|--------|
| GPT-NeoX | 20B | ‚úÖ Tested | Full semantic analysis support |
| LLaMA 2 | 7B | ‚úÖ Tested | Optimized cluster analysis |
| Qwen | 0.5B | ‚úÖ Tested | Fast analysis, great for testing |

> **Note**: More models are being tested and will be added to the list. If you'd like to contribute by testing additional models, please submit a PR!

## üöÄ Quick Start

Install directly from GitHub:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/klarity.git
```

Start analyzing your model:
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from klarity import UncertaintyEstimator

# Load your model
model_name = "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Initialize Klarity
estimator = UncertaintyEstimator()

# Get semantic insights with explanations
response = estimator.estimate(
    "What is the best programming language for AI?", 
    model, 
    tokenizer
)

# Access structured insights
print(f"Semantic Entropy: {response.metrics.semantic_entropy:.4f}")
print(f"Cluster Quality: {response.metrics.cluster_quality:.4f}")
print(f"Number of Semantic Clusters: {response.metrics.n_clusters}")

# Get LLM-powered analysis
print("\nInsights:")
print(f"Confidence Level: {response.insights.confidence_level}")
print(f"Primary Factor: {response.insights.primary_factor}")
print("\nRecommendations:")
for rec in response.insights.recommendations:
    print(f"- {rec}")
```

Example Output:
```
Semantic Entropy: 0.8234
Cluster Quality: 0.7645
Number of Semantic Clusters: 3

Insights:
Confidence Level: Medium
Primary Factor: Multiple valid programming paradigms

Recommendations:
- Consider specifying the AI domain (ML, NLP, Computer Vision)
- Add context about scalability requirements
- Clarify if looking for research or production use case
```
